              Kalinosi Victor Mutale, (b. 1972, Kasama, Northern Zambia), is an artist known for his innovative approach to visual expression.
              His artistic journey began at a young age, influenced by his creatively inclined sister and a schoolmate. His passion for art
              deepened over the years, and he later pursued formal art education at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam,
              The Netherlands, in 2002–2003. Mutale further expanded his artistic horizons through residencies at Cite Internationale des Arts
              in Paris, France, in 2007, and the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam again in 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mutale’s work spans a wide range of exhibitions, both group and solo, showcasing his unique style and conceptual depth. Recently,
              Kalinosi Mutale was among the Zambian artists featured at the 2025 India Art Fair and the 2024 iMPAC Festival in Lusaka. His 2020
              group exhibition, Drawn by Head, Thought by Pencil or Something Else, was held in Poznan, Poland. In 2014, he participated in the
              permanent exhibition Shiyala Sun Printing at the Chongwe General Hospital in Zambia, and in 2013, his work was showcased at the 37d
              Gallery in Lusaka, Zambia. Other notable group exhibitions include Poetry and Paintings in Lusaka in 2012, Scratching the Surface at
              the AVA Gallery in Cape Town, South Africa in 2008, and DE GROTE OVERSTEEK at Stedelijk Museum Zwolle in Amsterdam in 2006. His 2004
              participation in the Konse-Kubili exhibition at the Henry Tayali Gallery in Lusaka marked a pivotal moment in his career, alongside
              his involvement in the 26th São Paulo Biennial in Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to his group exhibitions, Mutale has held several solo exhibitions that have further solidified his reputation as an
              innovative artist. In 2005, he held Kali-Drawings at Alliance Française in Lusaka, Zambia, and in 2004, he exhibited Kalidraw at
              Galerie Jean Brolly in Paris, France. Earlier, in 2002, he had his first solo exhibition, Kwabena, in Krakow, Poland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mutale is also known for his active involvement in art workshops, where he has shared his expertise and collaborated with other
              artists. His workshops include Krysztal Centrum in Szczecin, Poland, and Munandi Art Studio in Chongwe, Zambia, where he worked on
              projects such as Power of Recycling in 2018 and Shiyala Sun Printings, Mothers of Africa in 2014. He has also facilitated workshops
              in Sweden, South Africa, and Poland, including Drawing Beyond Drawings in Simrishamn in 2005 and Thupelo Art Workshop in Cape Town in 2003.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mutale’s works are included in collections including the ARAK Collection in Doha, Qatar, and Bonaza Estate in Chongwe, Zambia. His
              artistic contributions have been recognized in publications such as Chronicles of the Road: Five Nations. Five Artists (ARAK, 2024),
              NKa Journal of Contemporary African Art (2006), and in articles by Andrew Mulenga including Hole in the Wall. He is also the Director

              David ‘Daut’ Makala (b.1983 Lusaka) is a Zambian self-taught artist and founder of Studio225, a collaborative self-funded studio in
              Chilenje, Lusaka. Makala’s artworks reflect his ongoing exploration of the way Zambians relate to their traditional heritage of Zambia,
              how they build identity with or without it and use it in navigating life.
            </p>
            <p>
              David looks at the processes of this search of identity and how people relate to memories of a lost past while using them to construct
              (disappearance) and reconstruct (reappearance) new ones. He took up art professionally in 2006 and is considered a renowned artist in
              Zambia and beyond. Mentored by Stary Mwaba, David has built his own path as a multimedia artist. His work has travelled to Asiko’ in
              Mozambique (2015), FNB Johannesburg Art Fair (2019), Gate44 Milan (2019), Congo Biennale (2022), and most recently El Salvador with
              Custom Made Stories in a public art intervention.

              Alick Phiri is a 75-year-old Zambian photographer born in Umvurwi, Zimbabwe, in 1948. In 1965, at the age of 17, he learnt photography at
              Lusaka’s Photo Art Studios on Cairo Road. Phiri was the youngest studio assistant and was trained in photography and film development by the
              studio’s owner, Mr. Prabhubhai Vilas.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1983, Phiri launched Kwacha Photo Studio in Kanyama, Lusaka. He is one of the few surviving black Zambian photographers professionally trained
              and practising from the 1960s through the 1990s in Lusaka, at a time when the profession was barely accessible to most Zambians. His archive offers
              rare insight into everyday experience in the city and bears witness to Lusaka’s past and the photographic medium’s relevance within Zambia’s social context.

              Maingaila Muvundika is a Lusaka-based conceptual artist who uses photography, digital collage and printmaking to explore human interactions within
              Zambia's diverse, syncretic society. His work subverts traditional portrayals of African men, offering layered narratives that challenge notions of
              identity, truth, and societal roles.

              in “Two Lizzards Sharing One Stomach” (Modzi Arts and Mbassy, Hamburg, 2023).

              Born 1982, in Lusaka, Zambia, Rabson Phiri’s work features an ingenious use of scrap metal, mainly car and bicycle parts. He spent his teenage years
              as a bicycle mechanic, which led him to his mentor, the late Friday Tembo. In 1998, when he visited Tembo’s Ulendo Studios in Linda compound, he was
              enthralled and accepted an offer to join Ulendo.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has worked with stone, scrap metal and hardwoods, attended workshops including a recycling workshop in Nigeria, and exhibited in numerous group shows.
              He won second prize in sculpture in 2010 for the Art for Wildlife competition, has been featured on CNN’s Inside Africa, exhibited in China (2016), and
              showed at BABIZ (Italy–Zambia Building an Art Bridge, 2022) and at 37d Gallery (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Form, 2023).
